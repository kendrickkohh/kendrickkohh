# 👋 Hey there, I’m Kendrick Koh

I'm a Cybersecurity enthusiast and Computer Science undergraduate from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Singapore 🇸🇬, currently diving deep into the world of offensive security, threat detection, and AI-driven cyber defense.

## 🛡️ About Me

- 🎓 Currently studying Computer Science with a strong focus on **Cybersecurity**, **Machine Learning** and **Generative AI**
- 🔐 Passionate about **Capture The Flag (CTF)** challenges, particularly in the forensics, web exploitation and OSINT categories.
- ⚙️ Experienced with tools like **Wireshark**, **Burp Suite**, and increasingly working with **Python**, **Linux**, and **Forensics libraries**.
- 📊 Interning at [DSTA](https://www.dsta.gov.sg) under the Cyber AI team, working on predictive models to detect Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) through domain clustering and classification.
- 🏅 Participated numerous CTFs, in particular my team achieve 50th place in GreyCTF hosted by [NUS Greyhats](https://nusgreyhats.org/). Read my write-up [here!](https://gist.github.com/kendrickkohh/6c10875ec554bf477bf29514e365263a).

## 🔍 Notable Projects

- 🔐 **Security on LLMs**: In-depth research on various methods to defend against malicious attacks targeting Large Language Models (LLMs).
- 🧠 **APT Domain Detection AI**: Uses machine learning to predict whether a domain is malicious (APT-related) based on features like entropy, age, nameservers, etc.
- 🗂️ **ParkLah!**: A dynamic parking app that allows a user to search and filter carparks with ease.

## 🚀 What I'm Exploring

- 🧠 **Generative AI & Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Applications leveraging LangChain, Ollama, FAISS and vector databases for secure and intelligent information retrieval.
- 🤖 **AI for Cybersecurity**: Applying clustering algorithms like DBSCAN to uncover malicious patterns in domain data, while exploring how Generative AI can support smarter cyber decision-making.
- 🔍 **Forensics**: Numerous tools that engage forensics capabilities such as ALEAPP and steganography tools

## 👨‍💻 Outside the Terminal

- 🏀 I love playing basketball, though I just rebound.  
- 🎤 Occasionally, I sing and play the guitar, bring me to karaoke please.  
- 🎮 I'm a gamer at heart, I love all things Riot Games, peaking Masters in TFT.
